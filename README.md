This is a data visualization project with a fun theme.

Here, you can view nearby alien spaceships using the Local Alien Detection Feature, or view motherships reported around earth during a selected time range using the Mothership Detection Feature.

The Mothership Detection data is actually asteroid data from nasa.gov, while the local aliens are randomly generated.

You will need a Nasa api key found here https://api.nasa.gov/ and a google maps developer key found here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key to execute the features yourself.
